# Stroke Prediction with Machine Learning
> An ischemic stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting
oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die in minutes. A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial. Early action
can reduce brain damage and other complications. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death
globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.

> **This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input
parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides
relevant information about the patient.**
